# Python Text Reader

This program was created to practice data manipulation in Python before starting a larger project. 

Program takes a comma-seperated value (CSV) file and tokenizes each line of the file into an array. The arrays are then appended into a matrix, where the data can then be manipulated and accessed using (row, column) coordinates. 

# Functions
